        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>March 04, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
        <p>When we left for the field in 2014 we had our website based on Wordpress. It was a great way of keeping people in touch with what we were doing.</p>
        <p>Over the years though, the demands of keeping up the platform became too much. Wordpress has a number of vulnerabilities that I needed to keep an eye on. The expense of using shared hosting and SSL certificates continued to increase as the years went by. In the end we were spending a couple hundred dollars per year on the site. So finally, reluctantly, we decided to close down the old WestonLisa.Org Blog. I was grieved, but we had no choice. Things were just not working.</p>
        <p>Since we have been back in the US my desire has grown to relaunch. A website is unparalleled when it comes to keeping people informed. Newsletters alone are just not enough to keep everyone informed. </p>
        <p>But what platform could we use? Could we avoid the expense of web hosting and SSL certificates? Was it possible to have a truly free website?? These conditions seemed impossible to meet.</p>
        <p>I believe God led me to discovering Bootstrap and Github Pages.</p>
