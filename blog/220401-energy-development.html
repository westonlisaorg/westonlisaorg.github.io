          <h2 class="blog-post-title">Energy Development</h2>
          <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>April 1, 2022 by Weston in Life</em></p>
          <p>One of the personal challenges I face is having low-energy.</p>
          <p>Last year I took a test as part of a leadership training course through our organization. One of the dimensions they tested me on was my level of "physical energy." This measured how much physical activity I am wired with. Some people are the go, go, go type. As you know, this is NOT me. So, I was not surprised to discover my number was low. But I had no idea how low it was.</p>
          <p>On a scale of 1-99, my score was 2.</p>
          <p>This is a particular challenge for me because there is almost no aspect of my job on the field that is not energy intensive. Sometimes I wish I could show up to work and someone would say, "We just need you to move the data from these columns over here." Or, "Stuff these envelopes but take your time. It's not urgent." That would be awesome. (I'm sure no one actually has a job like this.)</p>
          <p>Instead, my job is more like: "Listen to these people very carefully for the next several hours." And, "Put a tie on, stand in the heat for 3 hours and teach these sleeping kids some English." Or, "Read all these books and design a new evangelism strategy. Keep in mind, evangelism has never worked here before."</p>
          <p>(Sigh)</p>
          <p>Well, there's nothing I can do about the nature of my job. But this year I have been trying to develop some new strategies to help me cope with my physical energy limitations. I have thought of two things so far. (Let me know if you have any other ideas I can try.)</p>
          <p>The first is to exercise regularly. I believe this may help increase the energy capacity of my system. This was actually already a steady habit for me on the field. I didn't do it for this reason but it really helped me. It helped me process things and I felt so energized afterward. This year I developed a new training plan to gradually expand my body's energy system even further. I am very hopeful about this.</p>
          <p>The second is to keep a very tight leash on my To Do List. Because I am often feeling tired I have a tendency to put things off. This in turn creates a pile of work that is waiting for me when I return. Finally, deadlines become urgent and I have to conjure up enough energy to clear my to do list. But, due to the adrenaline and the long hours spent catching up, I end up more tired in the end than I was at the beginning of the cycle. A recovery period is required during which time new things start to pile up. Some seasons follow this pattern more than others but this is generally how I have lived most of my life.</p>
          <p>So, I've decided to make a change this year: to tenaciously get things done as soon as they appear, whether they are urgent or not. "Just get it done, now." I know this is not a new idea but I've come to realize how potentially valuable this system could be for me. I believe this will have the effect of keeping more energy in my system by preventing "the crash." This energy reserve can then be invested into "less urgent, more profitable" projects instead of saving it to catch up.</p>
          <p>I pray focusing on these two areas will help me become more energized and be more productive.</p>
