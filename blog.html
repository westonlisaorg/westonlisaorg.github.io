      <!--PHOENIX TIME EXTENDED 220318-->

        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>March 18, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
        <p>Lisa and I have decided to extend out time in Phoenix through May.</p>
        <p>Originally we planned to spend the month of May in Chicago doing a special time of prayer, planning and field preparation. But because we have been able to rest so well here in Phoenix we decided to do our pre-field preparation here instead of in Chicago.</p>
        <p><a href="https://westonlisa.org/pray/220228-rest-needed">This is a big answer to prayer.</a> Thank you for praying for rest! I daresay that this is almost the first time that Lisa and I have felt truly refreshed since we left for the field in 2014.</p>

      <!--WESTONLISA.ORG SEES NEW LIFE 220304-->
      <article class="py-3 blog-post border-bottom" id="220304">
        <a href="https://westonlisa.org/blog/220304-westonlisa-org-sees-new-life"><h2>WestonLisa.org Sees New Life</h2></a>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>March 4, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
        <p>When we left for the field in 2014 we had our website based on Wordpress. It was a great way of keeping people in touch with what we were doing.</p>
        <p>Over the years though, the demands of keeping up the platform became too much. Wordpress has a number of vulnerabilities that I needed to keep an eye on. The expense of using shared hosting and SSL certificates continued to increase as the years went by. In the end we were spending a couple hundred dollars per year on the site. So finally, reluctantly, we decided to close down the old WestonLisa.Org Blog. I was grieved, but we had no choice. Things were just not working.</p>
        <p>Since we have been back in the US my desire has grown to relaunch. A website is unparalleled when it comes to keeping people informed. Newsletters alone are just not enough to keep everyone informed. </p>
        <p>But what platform could we use? Could we avoid the expense of web hosting and SSL certificates? Was it possible to have a truly free website?? These conditions seemed impossible to meet.</p>
        <p>I believe God led me to discovering Bootstrap and Github Pages.</p>

        <p>Yesterday we concluded the mission conference at a certain senior citizen church in the Phoenix valley. It was an amazing and encouraging time.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>February 18, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
        <p>It is so amazing to finally be back in Phoenix. I always forget what a paradise this place is during the winter. Our last day in Chicago was 40 degrees and raining with ice on the ground. Such a difference!</p>

      <!--PACKING UP OUR CHICAGO LIFE 220211-->

        <a href="https://westonlisa.org/blog/220211-packing-up-our-chicago-life"><h2>Packing Up Our Chicago Life</h2></a>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>February 11, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
        <p>This week we have been packing up our house in Chicago and today we are saying goodbye. </p>
        <p>This is one of the hardest parts of the missionary life for me. I should have seen this coming but I am not ready to say goodbye. I was not able to prepare myself emotionally for this. But, ready or not, today is the last day.</p>
        <p>I will always remember this house fondly. It was only temporary and we have only lived here for one year but I will never forget it. God came and met with us here in this place. Wherever we are God's tabernacling presence follows us. It was especially so in this house. He provided all of our needs and more. He taught us so many hard but beautiful lessons. We spent sweet quality time with Lisa's Dad here. For him this was a house of healing.</p>
