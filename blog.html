        <!--FIELD PROGRESS UPDATE 220311-->
        <article class="py-3 blog-post border-bottom" id="220311">
          <a href="https://westonlisa.org/blog/220311-field-progress-update"><h2>Field Progress Update</h2></a>
          <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>March 11, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
          <p>On Tuesday, the 8th of March, we met with the Global Team from our sending church. This is the main accountability body we report to. This was a very encouraging time for us.</p>
          <p>We updated them regarding our last term on the field (2019-2020).</p>
          <h5>Progress:</h5>
          <h6>Completion of National Language Checks</h6>
          <p>Lisa completed her national language checks. This enables her to move on to other projects. She is the first person on our team to complete this. I passed my language check in Listening and Reading but I did not pass the Speaking portion.</p>
          <h6>Village Relationships Established</h6>
          <p>We developed deep relationships with village leaders in three communities. This is important because our team's mission is village church planting. So, village access is everything.</p>
          <h6>Strategic Plan Developed</h6>
          <p>Our team was able to agree on a strategic plan. Our team spent aproximately 6 months in 2020 in discussions hammering out how we will attempt to see new churches planted in our target area.</p>
          <h5>Problems:</h5>
          <h6>Team Attrition</h6>
          <p>We saw the attrition of three family units from our team. Adaptation to rural, village life in Bee Creek was very challenging and I think this hit our team pretty hard. As a result of this and other factors we lost 3 units from our team.</p>
          <h6>Team Disagreement</h6>
          <h6>Covid-19</h6>
          <p>The global pandemic created a number of challenges for our team. Safety, isolation and the stopping of all activities meant much of our active ministry was put on hold.</p>
          <h5>Plans:</h5>
          <h6>Complete Final Language Check</h6>
          <h6>Lead Team to Function Well</h6>

          <a href="https://westonlisa.org/blog/220304-westonlisa-org-sees-new-life"><h2>WestonLisa.org Sees New Life</h2></a>
          <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>March 4, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
          <p>When we left for the field in 2014 we had our website based on Wordpress. It was a great way of keeping people in touch with what we were doing.</p>
          <p>Over the years though, the demands of keeping up the platform became too much. Wordpress has a number of vulnerabilities that I needed to keep an eye on. The expense of using shared hosting and SSL certificates continued to increase as the years went by. In the end we were spending a couple hundred dollars per year on the site. So finally, reluctantly, we decided to close down the old WestonLisa.Org Blog. I was grieved, but we had no choice. Things were just not working.</p>
          <p>Since we have been back in the US my desire has grown to relaunch. A website is unparalleled when it comes to keeping people informed. Newsletters alone are just not enough to keep everyone informed. </p>
          <p>But what platform could we use? Could we avoid the expense of web hosting and SSL certificates? Was it possible to have a truly free website?? These conditions seemed impossible to meet.</p>
          <p>I believe God led me to discovering Bootstrap and Github Pages.</p>

          <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>February 25, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
          <p>Yesterday we concluded the mission conference at a certain senior citizen church in the Phoenix valley. It was an amazing and encouraging time.</p>

          <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>February 18, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
          <p>It is so amazing to finally be back in Phoenix. I always forget what a paradise this place is during the winter. Our last day in Chicago was 40 degrees and raining with ice on the ground. Such a difference!</p>

        <!--PACKING UP OUR CHICAGO LIFE 220211-->
        <article class="py-3 blog-post" id="220211">
          <a href="https://westonlisa.org/blog/220211-packing-up-our-chicago-life"><h2>Packing Up Our Chicago Life</h2></a>
          <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>February 11, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
          <p>This week we have been packing up our house in Chicago and today we are saying goodbye. </p>
          <p>This is one of the hardest parts of the missionary life for me. I should have seen this coming but I am not ready to say goodbye. I was not able to prepare myself emotionally for this. But, ready or not, today is the last day.</p>
          <p>I will always remember this house fondly. It was only temporary and we have only lived here for one year but I will never forget it. God came and met with us here in this place. Wherever we are God's tabernacling presence follows us. It was especially so in this house. He provided all of our needs and more. He taught us so many hard but beautiful lessons. We spent sweet quality time with Lisa's Dad here. For him this was a house of healing.</p>
