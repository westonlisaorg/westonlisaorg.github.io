      <!--PRESSURE FROM VILLAGERS 221127-->
      <article class="py-3 blog-post border-bottom" id="221127">
        <a href="./pray/221127.html"><h2>Pressure from Villagers</h2></a>
        <p class="blog-post-meta mb-0"><em>November 27, 2022 by Weston in <a href="./pray.html">Pray</a></em></p>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>Topic: <a href="./topic/pure-glory-village.html">Pure Glory Village</a></em></p>
        <p>Today I spoke with Pastor Celebrate and James about the ministry in Pure Glory Village and he said that it appears that the new believers are being pressured by other unbelieving villagers to stop meeting with James, Pastor Celebrate and the others that come and assist in the teaching and worship there. Yesterday, Small, one of the new believers, declined to speak with Pastor Celebrate and the regulary Saturday meeting was cancelled.</p>
        <p>Pressure from unbelievers in local villages is very common throughout the country. It is especially so in the rural countryside where we work so we are not surprised by this. In fact, it is an innevitable reality that we all much face as followers of Jesus. The main concern for these new believers is that they have so little knowledge and experience to draw from as they face this pressure.</p>
        <p>Please pray:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The new believers will stand fast in their young faith.</li>
          <li>God will miraculously meet them in their emotions, doubts and fears.</li>
          <li>Pastor Celebrate and James will be able to actually sit down and speak with the believers and hear their troubles, concerns and give them encouragement to continue meeting.</li>
          <li>More facts about what has happened may be collected so there is a very clear picture of what is going on. Fuzy "he said, she said" stories is an old tactic of the enemy to waste time and energy.</li>
          <li>God would draw with those who are opposing the gospel proclamation, or at least, silence this opposition.</li>

      <!--SEARCHING FOR A MINISTRY STRATEGY WITH DUNE 221109-->
      <article class="py-3 blog-post" id="221109">
        <a href="./pray/221109.html"><h2>Searching for a Ministry Strategy with Dune</h2></a>
        <p class="blog-post-meta mb-0"><em>November 9, 2022 by Weston in <a href="./pray.html">Pray</a></em></p>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>Topic: <a href="./topic/dune.html">Dune</a></em></p>
        <p>Please pray for me this week as I have been wrestling through how the work might progress with <a href="./topic/dune.html">Dune</a> and her children, Film and Sophia. Pastor Celebrate and everyone else, myself included, seem to be at a complete loss as to what the goals might be and how progress might be made.</p>
        <p>I have spent some time praying through these things and I have come away with these questions which I believe might be key in guiding us forward.</p>
        <h6>Questions for Pastor Celebrate</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>What are the physical needs of the family that we might be able to help meet?</li>
          <li>What are the needs of Film and Sophia, of all kinds, that we could help meet?</li>
          <li>If I went to visit the family regularly, do you see a way that I could gradually teach them more about God? How might that work? Is there an open door now? If not, how could we see that door open? I believe if they are willing to receive regular teaching this could really change everything as they are transformed by the truth.</li>
          <li>Do you think it is possible to find a regular opportunity to lay hands on and pray for Dune?</li>
          <li>If I went to visit the family by myself, do you see any dangers that I need to be aware of?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I have sent these questions to Pastor Celebrate and have arranged to meet with him in the afternoon on Sunday the 13th of November to discuss these questions and plan a strategy forward.</p>
        <p>Please pray that <em>God would bless our meeting and new clarity would emerge</em> as to how to help Dune move forward in her relationship with the Lord and recovery from drug addiction. Please pray also for her kids, Film and Sophia, that <em>the Lord would protect them and bring them into a relationship with Him also</em>.</p>
