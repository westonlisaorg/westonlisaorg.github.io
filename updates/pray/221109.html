        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Searching for a Ministry Strategy with Dune</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta mb-0"><em>November 9, 2022 by Weston in <a href="../pray.html">Pray</a></em></p>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>Topic: <a href="../topic/dune.html">Dune</a></em></p>
        <p>Please pray for me this week as I have been wrestling through how the work might progress with <a href="../topic/dune.html">Dune</a> and her children, Film and Sophia. Pastor Celebrate and everyone else, myself included, seem to be at a complete loss as to what the goals might be and how progress might be made.</p>
        <p>I have spent some time praying through these things and I have come away with these questions which I believe might be key in guiding us forward.</p>
        <h6>Questions for Pastor Celebrate</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>What are the physical needs of Dune and the family that we might be able to help meet?</li>
          <li>What are the needs of Film and Sophia, of all kinds, that we could help meet?</li>
          <li>If I went to visit the family regularly, do you see a way that I could gradually teach them more about God? How might that work? Is there an open door now? If not, how could we see that door open? I believe if they are willing to receive regular teaching this could really change everything as they are transformed by the truth.</li>
          <li>Do you think it is possible to find a regular opportunity to lay hands on and pray for Dune?</li>
          <li>If I went to visit the family by myself, do you see any dangers that I need to be aware of?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I have sent these questions to Pastor Celebrate and have arranged to meet with him in the afternoon on Sunday the 13th of November to discuss these questions and plan a strategy forward.</p>
        <p>Please pray that <em>God would bless our meeting and new clarity would emerge</em> as to how to help Dune move forward in her relationship with the Lord and recovery from drug addiction. Please pray also for her kids, Film and Sophia, that <em>the Lord would protect them and bring them into a relationship with Him also</em>.</p>
