      <!--RETURNING TO THAILAND 220812-->
      <article class="py-3 blog-post border-bottom" id="220812"> 
        <a href="./news/220812.html"><h2>Returning to Thailand</h2></a>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em><a href="./2022/08.html">August</a> 12, <a href="./2022.html">2022</a> by Weston in <a href="./news.html">News</a></em></p>
        <p>Dear friends and church families,</p>
        <p>We are so happy to inform you that we are returning to Thailand on the 23rd of August. The Lord has provided visas and we have tickets in hand. Everything is set for our departure.</p>
        <p>We are SO excited to be finally returning to our home and ministry in Bee Creek!! The past 18 months has been a very challenging season of serving and waiting and, quite frankly, it feels so good that we are finally closing this chapter.</p>
        <p>Even so, we are mindful of God's grace to teach us so many important lessons as we cared for Lisa's father, led the team remotely during the Covid lock-downs and made ourselves as productive as possible from the US.</p>
        <p>As we pack our bags and say our goodbyes I've noticed that things feel quite different than previous terms of service and I think it is indicative of the changes that have taken place in us. I sense a more disciplined heart: we crave more intimate time with the Lord than some of the distractions we can been prone to. There is a greater sense of resolve in completing our mission: God's kingdom being established among the Isaan people and is worth any cost to ourselves.</p>
        <p>Some of these are areas of heart change I have been praying about for years. How merciful our Father is to give us the desires of hearts in becoming more like Him (Heb.12:10). It reminds me again that God's work of transformation comes often through the especially hard seasons (Jam.1:2-4).</p>
        <p>As the field looms large ahead, there are a couple of changes that I want to tell you about as we return.</p>
        <p>First, a major departure from previous terms is that Lisa will now be the NGO volunteer and main visa holder. As you know, we are given a visa to Thailand in exchange for providing some kind of service to the community in which we reside. For the past few months Lisa and a Thai ministry partner have been making plans for a new ministry. Upon arrival Lisa will have 90 days to get the project off the ground and report back to the government so that we can be issued a 1 year visa. Please be praying for Lisa as she assumes this large responsibility.</p>
        <p>With the visa responsibility off my shoulders I can devote more time to further developing and implementing our team's long-term church planting strategy. This began in 2020 when our team spent approximately 6 months hammering it out together. Our church planting strategy will have three phases: <em>evangelism</em> leading to baptism, <em>discipleship</em> leading to church formation and <em>leadership training</em> leading to appointment of new elders. All three of these phases are critical to the establishment of a new, healthy, independent gospel community. What now remains is to further develop our methodology and timeline for this strategy to become a reality. This is the <em>how</em> and <em>when</em> of the church planting effort. I will be taking on this challenge when we arrive.</p>
        <p>These are exciting times, friends. Thank you so much for your continued prayer and support and for continuing to stand behind us as we strive toward God's glory in Isaan.</p>
        <p>We will see you on the flip side!</p>
        <p>Truly yours,</p>
        <p>Weston and Lisa</p>

        <p>This week my heart has been particularly pressed to pray and seek after God's will in the coming term on the field. It is so easy to make assumptions that we know God's mind.</p>

        <a href="./pray/220328.html"><h2>James Ministry Vision Part 2</h2></a> 
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em><a href="./2022/03.html">March</a> 28, <a href="./2022.html">2022</a> by Weston in <a href="./pray.html">Pray</a></em></p>
        <p><a href="./pray/220322.html">In our last prayer update</a> I wrote about James' ministry plan and my meeting with Dennis. This meeting went very well and he helped me think things through. Thank you for praying.</p>
        <p>This week please pray as I prepare for meetings with with James' sending church pastor, David (March 29). This will be my first time meeting with him. I will also be giving James feedback regarding his ministry plan on March 30th.</p>
        <p>Just to be clear: there is nothing negative under review in these meetings. All of these meetings are routine. I am requesting prayer because it is meetings like these that really stretch me as a leader and require me to pray a lot and seek the Lord's wisdom when I am giving members input.</p>
        <p>Please pray:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>God would give me wisdom this week as I prepare for meetings on the 29th and 30th.</li>
          <li>God would give me sensitivity and understanding as I ask questions, listen and discuss the ministry plan with David and James.</li>
          <li>God would give me discernment and insight as I compile my final ministry plan input for James.</li>
          <li>Pray for James as he receives this input and continues seeking the Lord's will in his next term on the field (starting April 30th).</li>

      <!--FIELD PROGRESS UPDATE 220325-->
      <article class="py-3 blog-post border-bottom" id="220325">
        <a href="./reports/220325.html"><h2>Field Progress Update</h2></a> 
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em><a href="./2022/03.html">March</a> 25, <a href="./2022.html">2022</a> by Weston in <a href="./reports.html">Reports</a></em></p>
        <p>On the 8th of March, we met with the Global Team from our sending church. This is the main accountability body to which we report. It was a very encouraging time for us as we gave them a short report regarding our last term on the field (2019-2020).</p>
        <h5>Progress:</h5>
        <h6>Village Access</h6>
        <p>We developed relationships with village leaders in three communities. This is important because our team's mission is village church planting. So, village access is everything.</p>
        <h6>Strategic Planning</h6>
        <p>Our team was able to agree on a church planting plan. We spent aproximately 6 months in 2020 hammering out our strategic plan for  how we will work toward new church plants in our target area.</p>
        <p>Our strategy is to focus on and further develop three ministries areas: (a) Evangelism leading to baptism, (b) Discipleship leading to church formation and (c) Leadership Training leading to appointment of new elders/pastors. So, preach, teach, train.</p>
        <h6>Language Checks</h6>
        <p>Lisa completed her national language checks. This enables her to move on to other projects. She is the first person on our team to complete this. (I passed my language check in Listening and Reading but I did not pass the Speaking portion.)</p>
        <h5>Problems:</h5>
        <h6>Team Challenges</h6>
        <p>Our team really struggled. We walked through exhausting, extended conflicts together. Adaptation to rural, village life in Bee Creek also hit everyone hard. In the end we lost three family units. This took a massive toll on Lisa and me.</p>
        <h6>Covid-19</h6>
        <p>It's not surprising but this created a number of challenges for our team. Safety concerns for our team members and local villagers meant much of our ministry was put on hold.</p>
        <h5>Plans for Next Term:</h5>
        <h6>Complete Language Check</h6>
        <p>This term I need to pass my national language check. This will require devoting additional time developing my speaking ability. </p>
        <h6>Team Leadership</h6>
        <p>One of the most urgent goals is to get our team functioning well. My strategy to accomplish this is to focus on the basics by communicating clearly the minimum standards for our team and supporting each member as they work to reach those standards.</p>
        <h6>Further Develop Strategic Plan</h6>
        <p>This is a tentative goal at this point but I would like to further research and develop our team's understanding of our three ministry areas (outlined above) and how they might be accomplished in our context.</p>
        <h6>Develop New Village Ministry</h6>
        <p>One major change that will take place in our new term is that Lisa will take over as the primary visa holder. This will require her to develop a new village ministry which will be the basis of our visa agreement with the government. Lisa is excited about this new venture. She desires to develop a new village ministry which will give us greater access to people's lives in rural areas.</p>

        <p>James is one of our teammates. He is currently in Australia on Home Assignment. Since December he and I have been working on his Ministry Vision and Equipping Plan for his next term on the field which starts on May 1st. Last week James submitted his final draft to me for my approval.</p>
        <p>This week I will be praying through the document and will be discussing it with Dennis, our field leader. Our goal is to provide helpful feedback for James to consider, making his plan more clear, measurable and effective. </p>
        <p>My desire is to be able to approve this plan next week.</p>
        <p>As Dennis and I meet on Thursday, the 24th, please pray:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We will find helpful feedback for James.</li>
          <li>I would see clearly the kind of support from me James needs to be effective.</li>
          <li>God would be glorfied through this plan and the work he is preparing for James in the coming term.</li>

        <p>Originally we planned to spend the month of May in Chicago doing a special time of prayer, planning and field preparation. But because we have been able to rest so well here in Phoenix we decided to do our pre-field preparation here instead of in Chicago.</p>

They haved completed their first year in Blackriver province. This is my first time doing a debrief during a term but I thought it would be good to debrief together since the first year is such a crucial period. (Usually debriefs are conducted at the conclusion of a term of service.)</p>
        <p>Debrief sessions are very special to me as a team leader. They are opportunities to listen, pray and encourage. I always see God speak to members as they seek him and celebrate him faithfulness.</p>
        <p>Please pray:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>God would lead me as I prepare the activities, materials and schedule.</li>
          <li>God would speak to Josh and Mindy as they reflect and seek him.</li>
          <li>Josh and Mindy would be refreshed and encouraged during the debrief on March 20, 22.</li>

        <p>When we left for the field in 2014 we had our website based on Wordpress. It was a great way of keeping people in touch with what we were doing.</p>
        <p>Over the years though, the demands of keeping up the platform became too much. Wordpress has a number of vulnerabilities that I needed to keep an eye on. The expense of using shared hosting and SSL certificates continued to increase as the years went by. In the end we were spending a couple hundred dollars per year on the site. So finally, reluctantly, we decided to close down the old WestonLisa.Org blog. I was grieved, but we had no choice. Things were just not working.</p>
        <p>Since we have been back in the US my desire has grown to relaunch. A website is unparalleled when it comes to keeping people informed. Newsletters alone are just not enough to keep everyone informed. </p>
        <p>But what platform could we use? Could we avoid the expense of web hosting and SSL certificates? Was it possible to have a truly free website?? These conditions seemed impossible to meet.</p>
        <p>I believe God led me to discovering Bootstrap and Github Pages.</p>

        <p>On the 8th of January Lisa's father, Jing, returned home to live with Mom. It is a big answer to prayer that his health has improved enough to return home.</p>
        <h4>One Year Care-Giving Journey</h4>
        <p>When we returned to Chicago in February 2021 we weren't sure how long we would be here. We knew only that Lisa's Mom desperately needed a break and that Dad needed more thorough care. There were a lot of unknowns in his situation, most of which required an in-depth assessment of Jing's health to resolve. </p>
        <p>Over the past twelve months, Lisa, with the help of her sisters, has spent enormous amounts of time and energy caring for her Dad, observing his condition, testing new diet ideas, getting health assessments from doctors, evaluating and eliminating some unnecessary medications and discussing with Lisa’s mom the help she would need if Dad moves back home. While there has been no dramatic change in Jing's condition, there has been a gradual improvement and finally the discovery and treatment of a persistent infection. In December, it became clear that there was nothing remaining for us to 'figure out' and, because Jing was feeling better overall, the burden of care had been reduced enough for him to move back home. We praise God for this!</p>
        <p>Dad and Mom are settled at home now but they still require help to live on their own. Finding caregivers is very challenging everywhere, but especially so in Chicago. This has been a big concern. But we have had no choice but to trust that only God can and will provide. He has never forsaken us! We have been absolutely amazed how God has provided able and willing people to step into this role at just the right time. Lisa has spent the last three weeks helping Mom and Dad transition and training the new caregivers to take over this role. Lisa's last day of responsibilities was Friday.</p>
        <p>We do covet your continued prayers for Lisa, her parents and sisters as they walk through what has been a very trying time. Also please pray for Lisa's Mom who now bears a lot of the burden of care once again. </p>
        <h4>Return to the Field</h4>
        <p>With Dad settled at home we believe it is the right time to return to the field. We have requested clearance to return from our sponsoring church, sending base and field leadership and are hopeful we will receive this by mid-February. We plan to be back on the field in early Summer.</p>
        <p>We have much to do before we can return. Here is a rough outline of our goals and travel plans:</p>
        <ol class="list-unstyled">
          <li><strong>Feb-March</strong> -- Support raising | Phoenix, Los Angeles</li>
          <li><strong>April-May</strong> -- Support raising, field term planning | Chicago</li>
          <li><strong>June</strong> -- Visa applications, misc. travel | Chicago, Orlando</li>
          <li><strong>July</strong> -- Return to Thailand</li>
        </ol>
        <p>More details are forthcoming regarding our events and presentations at various locations. We look forward to the coming months, visiting and connecting with you in person before we return to the task appointed to us by God in Thailand.</p>
        <h4>Thank You for Your Support</h4>
        <p>As we close this chapter of our journey we want to pause and thank you: our friends, home churches, prayer warriors and supporters who have stuck with us through this long and difficult season. At times the frustration and weight of responsibility was unbearable. Without your prayers, encouragement and generosity we could not have made it financially, spiritually or emotionally to the point of being able to return to the field. Because of your prayers and generosity we have seen God provide everything we have needed and more. I know that Lisa's entire family is grateful to you for your sacrifice in 'holding the ropes' for us while we served her Dad. We thank God for you and ask that He will bless you for your faithfulness.</p>
        <p>Lastly, all praise to the grace of our Savior!</p>
        <p>Truly yours,</p>
        <p>Weston and Lisa</p>
