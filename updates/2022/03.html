      <!--JAMES MINISTRY VISION PART 2 220328-->
      <article class="py-3 blog-post border-bottom" id="220328">
        <a href="../pray/220328.html"><h2>James Ministry Vision Part 2</h2></a> 
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em><a href="./03.html">March</a> 28, <a href="../2022.html">2022</a> by Weston in <a href="../pray.html">Pray</a></em></p>
        <p><a href="../pray/220322.html">In our last prayer update</a> I wrote about James' ministry plan and my meeting with Dennis. This meeting went very well and he helped me think things through. Thank you for praying.</p>
        <p>This week please pray as I prepare for meetings with with James' sending church pastor, David (March 29). This will be my first time meeting with him. I will also be giving James feedback regarding his ministry plan on March 30th.</p>
        <p>Just to be clear: there is nothing negative under review in these meetings. All of these meetings are routine. I am requesting prayer because it is meetings like these that really stretch me as a leader and require me to pray a lot and seek the Lord's wisdom when I am giving members input.</p>
        <p>Please pray:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>God would give me wisdom this week as I prepare for meetings on the 29th and 30th.</li>
          <li>God would give me sensitivity and understanding as I ask questions, listen and discuss the ministry plan with David and James.</li>
          <li>God would give me discernment and insight as I compile my final ministry plan input for James.</li>
          <li>Pray for James as he receives this input and continues seeking the Lord's will in his next term on the field (starting April 30th).</li>

      <!--FIELD PROGRESS UPDATE 220325-->
      <article class="py-3 blog-post border-bottom" id="220325">
        <a href="../reports/220325.html"><h2>Field Progress Update</h2></a> 
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em><a href="./03.html">March</a> 25, <a href="../2022.html">2022</a> by Weston in <a href="../reports.html">Reports</a></em></p>
        <p>On the 8th of March, we met with the Global Team from our sending church. This is the main accountability body to which we report. It was a very encouraging time for us as we gave them a short report regarding our last term on the field (2019-2020).</p>
        <h5>Progress:</h5>
        <h6>Village Access</h6>
        <p>We developed relationships with village leaders in three communities. This is important because our team's mission is village church planting. So, village access is everything.</p>
        <h6>Strategic Planning</h6>
        <p>Our team was able to agree on a church planting plan. We spent aproximately 6 months in 2020 hammering out our strategic plan for  how we will work toward new church plants in our target area.</p>
        <p>Our strategy is to focus on and further develop three ministries areas: (a) Evangelism leading to baptism, (b) Discipleship leading to church formation and (c) Leadership Training leading to appointment of new elders/pastors. So, preach, teach, train.</p>
        <h6>Language Checks</h6>
        <p>Lisa completed her national language checks. This enables her to move on to other projects. She is the first person on our team to complete this. (I passed my language check in Listening and Reading but I did not pass the Speaking portion.)</p>
        <h5>Problems:</h5>
        <h6>Team Challenges</h6>
        <p>Our team really struggled. We walked through exhausting, extended conflicts together. Adaptation to rural, village life in Bee Creek also hit everyone hard. In the end we lost three family units. This took a massive toll on Lisa and me.</p>
        <h6>Covid-19</h6>
        <p>It's not surprising but this created a number of challenges for our team. Safety concerns for our team members and local villagers meant much of our ministry was put on hold.</p>
        <h5>Plans for Next Term:</h5>
        <h6>Complete Language Check</h6>
        <p>This term I need to pass my national language check. This will require devoting additional time developing my speaking ability. </p>
        <h6>Team Leadership</h6>
        <p>One of the most urgent goals is to get our team functioning well. My strategy to accomplish this is to focus on the basics by communicating clearly the minimum standards for our team and supporting each member as they work to reach those standards.</p>
        <h6>Further Develop Strategic Plan</h6>
        <p>This is a tentative goal at this point but I would like to further research and develop our team's understanding of our three ministry areas (outlined above) and how they might be accomplished in our context.</p>
        <h6>Develop New Village Ministry</h6>
        <p>One major change that will take place in our new term is that Lisa will take over as the primary visa holder. This will require her to develop a new village ministry which will be the basis of our visa agreement with the government. Lisa is excited about this new venture. She desires to develop a new village ministry which will give us greater access to people's lives in rural areas.</p>

      <article class="py-3 blog-post border-bottom" id="220322">
        <a href="../pray/220322.html"><h2>James Ministry Vision & Equipping Plan</h2></a>

        <p>James is one of our teammates. He is currently in Australia on Home Assignment. Since December he and I have been working on his Ministry Vision and Equipping Plan for his next term on the field which starts on May 1st. Last week James submitted his final draft to me for my approval.</p>
        <p>This week I will be praying through the document and will be discussing it with Dennis, our field leader. Our goal is to provide helpful feedback for James to consider, making his plan more clear, measurable and effective. </p>
        <p>My desire is to be able to approve this plan next week.</p>
        <p>As Dennis and I meet on Thursday, the 24th, please pray:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We will find helpful feedback for James.</li>
          <li>I would see clearly the kind of support from me James needs to be effective.</li>
          <li>God would be glorfied through this plan and the work he is preparing for James in the coming term.</li>

      <article class="py-3 blog-post border-bottom" id="220318">
        <a href="../reports/220318.html"><h2>Phoenix Time Extended</h2></a>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em><a href="./03.html">March</a> 18, <a href="../2022.html">2022</a> by Weston in <a href="../reports.html">Reports</a></em></p>
        <p>Lisa and I have decided to extend out time in Phoenix through May.</p>
        <p>Originally we planned to spend the month of May in Chicago doing a special time of prayer, planning and field preparation. But because we have been able to rest so well here in Phoenix we decided to do our pre-field preparation here instead of in Chicago.</p>
        <p><a href="./pray/220228.html">This is a big answer to prayer.</a> Thank you for praying for rest! I daresay that this is almost the first time that Lisa and I have felt truly refreshed since we left for the field in 2014.</p>

      <!--JOSH MINDY DEBRIEF 220314-->
      <article class="py-3 blog-post border-bottom" id="220314">
        <a href="../pray/220314.html"><h2>Josh & Mindy Debrief</h2></a> 
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em><a href="./03.html">March</a> 14, <a href="../2022.html">2022</a> by Weston in <a href="../pray.html">Pray</a></em></p>
        <p>Next week, on the 20th and 22nd, I will be doing a debrief time with Josh and Mindy, our teammates who are currently on the field. They haved completed their first year in Blackriver province. This is my first time doing a debrief during a term but I thought it would be good to debrief together since the first year is such a crucial period. (Usually debriefs are conducted at the conclusion of a term of service.)</p>
        <p>Debrief sessions are very special to me as a team leader. They are opportunities to listen, pray and encourage. I always see God speak to members as they seek him and celebrate him faithfulness.</p>
        <p>Please pray:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>God would lead me as I prepare the activities, materials and schedule.</li>
          <li>God would speak to Josh and Mindy as they reflect and seek him.</li>
          <li>Josh and Mindy would be refreshed and encouraged during the debrief on March 20, 22.</li>

        <p>Lisa and I have decided to attempt a reboot of our cancelled reception in December. We are planning it for the month of May.</p>
        <p>I will be spending a lot of time over the next month preparing for this time and writing out what we believe the Lord wants us to share.</p>
        <p>Please pray God would show us clearly what he wants us to share and discuss at this event.</p>

      <article class="py-3 blog-post" id="220304">
        <a href="../reports/220304.html"><h2>WestonLisa.org Sees New Life</h2></a>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em><a href="./03.html">March</a> 4, <a href="../2022.html">2022</a> by Weston in <a href="../reports.html">Reports</a></em></p>
        <p>When we left for the field in 2014 we had our website based on Wordpress. It was a great way of keeping people in touch with what we were doing.</p>
        <p>Over the years though, the demands of keeping up the platform became too much. Wordpress has a number of vulnerabilities that I needed to keep an eye on. The expense of using shared hosting and SSL certificates continued to increase as the years went by. In the end we were spending a couple hundred dollars per year on the site. So finally, reluctantly, we decided to close down the old WestonLisa.Org blog. I was grieved, but we had no choice. Things were just not working.</p>
        <p>Since we have been back in the US my desire has grown to relaunch. A website is unparalleled when it comes to keeping people informed. Newsletters alone are just not enough to keep everyone informed. </p>
        <p>But what platform could we use? Could we avoid the expense of web hosting and SSL certificates? Was it possible to have a truly free website?? These conditions seemed impossible to meet.</p>
        <p>I believe God led me to discovering Bootstrap and Github Pages.</p>
