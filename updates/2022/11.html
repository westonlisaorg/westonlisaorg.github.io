        <a href="../news/221128.html"><h2>Back Home and In Ministry | Oct-Nov</h2></a>
        <p class="blog-post-meta mb-0"><em><a href="../2022/11.html">November</a> 27, <a href="../2022.html">2022</a> by Weston in <a href="../news.html">News</a></em></p>
        <p>We have been back in Thailand for three months and it has been a fast paced adventure since we stepped back on Thai soil.</p>
        <h4 id="return">Return to Bee Creek</h4>
        <p><a href="../reports/220913.html">We were pretty scared</a> opening the doors of our house after 18 months of no one living there but were pleasantly surprised that everything was still where we put it and only a little bit dusty. It was a little hard to believe actually.</p>
        <p>Our reunion with the team in Bee Creek was very sweet indeed. It's been years since we were in person with James, Josh and Mindy. So grateful to have such wonderful teammates and partners in the Gospel. It's been amazing to see our Thai friends again also. "Wow. You've gotten so big!" is something I've been hearing a lot. "No. You just forgot how fat I was."</p>
        <h4>Trip to Chiang Mai</h4>
        <h5>Work Permit for Lisa</h5>
        <p>After cleaning the house a bit we were off again to Chiang Mai to get a Work Permit for Lisa. <a href="../reports/220908.html">We were amazed that she was given two years</a> which also garantees our visa for the next two years. We are praising the Lord for this vital provision.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/reports/wp.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""><figcaption class="figure-caption">Lisa is now ready for business</figcaption></figure>
        <p>She is hard at work with her Foundation project. Unfortunately, <a href="./220812.html#lisa">the project that she had originally set up</a> before we returned completely fell through when we actually arrived. But the Lord has provided a new direction and Lisa is hard at work. <a href="../reports/221015.html">You can read her recent Foundation report here</a>.</p>
        <h5>Meeting Anita</h5>
        <p>We also finally had the privilege of meeting in person with Anita, a new teammate who is doing language study in Chiang Mai for the next two years before joining our team in Isaan. It was a miracle that she was able to be deployed during the Covid season and the Lord provided a temporary team for her to call home in Chiang Mai while she studies Thai. Her first trip out to visit the team in Bee Creek will take place in December, 2022</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/news/cmvisit.JPG" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""><figcaption class="figure-caption">Anita, Lisa and Weston face-to-face at last after two years of video conferencing</figcaption></figure>
        <h4 id="ministry">Ministry Update</h4>
        <p>On the ministry front there are a couple of important things to update you on.</p>
        <h5 id="dune">Sharing the Gospel with Dune, a Drug Addict</h5>
        <p>We have reconnected with Pastor Celebrate, a local minister who has a broad vision for gospel fruit in the surrounding villages. One of the families he has been working with for years is the family of Dune, a 34 year old woman who is addicted to Methamphetamine. She has two kids in the house, Film (10) and Sophia (8). Her boyfriend lives with them.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/reports/shack4.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""><figcaption class="figure-caption">Left to right: granny, Pastor Celebrate, Film, Dune, boyfriend, Weston</figcaption></figure>
        <p>In October, Pastor Celebrate felt the urgency to go and share the gospel with them and we were invited to accompany him. Dune really opened up about her background and we were heartbroken to hear about the many tramatic events she experience as a child and young teen. Pregnancy and drug addiction started early. It is a heartbreaking story that is all too common in this part of the country. The story is not over though! We are praying and trusting that she will come to know God's plan for her future; a future full of right relationships, healing from her trauma, cleansing from her addictions and a new birth into the family of God.</p>
        <p>This ministry is ongoing and you can <a href="../topic/dune.html">read about it at length here</a>.</p>
        <h5 id="puregloryvillage">New Believers in Pure Glory Village</h5>
        <p>Our team is celebrating the first new believers in our target area. This took place in late September through the ministry of James and Pastor Celebrate in Pure Glory Village, Plate Hill County. Since that time James, Pastor Celebrate and an assorted team of local Christians have been visiting on Saturdays to teach, encourage and strengthen the new believers.</p>
        <p>We covet your prayers for them because, as of this writing, there appears to have been some pressure from local Buddhists to abandon the meetings. This is very common but easily could put a stop to the faith of these young believers very quickly. We request urgent prayers for them as they learn to face opposition.</p>
        <p><a href="../topic/pure-glory-village.html">Updates to this situation will be posted here</a>.</p>
        <h5 id="website">Website Relaunch</h5>
        <p>As you can see, we have rebuilt our website. Some of you might remember our old website when we first came to the field. Over the years it became very expensive to maintain and so we had no choice but to take it down temporarily. <a href="../reports/220304.html">Since March</a>, I have been working to get a new website up and I am quite happy with the result. It looks great on a phone and is very fast. My prayer is it will especially enable us to keep you updated on urgent prayer needs and more detailed reports from the field. These things are difficult to do over an email newsletter.</p>

      <!--PRESSURE FROM VILLAGERS 221127-->
      <article class="py-3 blog-post border-bottom" id="221127">
        <a href="../pray/221127.html"><h2>Pressure from Villagers</h2></a>
        <p class="blog-post-meta mb-0"><em><a href="../2022/11.html">November</a> 27, <a href="../2022.html">2022</a> by Weston in <a href="../pray.html">Pray</a></em></p>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>Topic: <a href="../topic/pure-glory-village.html">Pure Glory Village</a></em></p>
        <p>Today I spoke with Pastor Celebrate and James about the ministry in Pure Glory Village and he said that it appears that the new believers are being pressured by other unbelieving villagers to stop meeting with James, Pastor Celebrate and the others that come and assist in the teaching and worship there. Yesterday, Small, one of the new believers, declined to speak with Pastor Celebrate and the regulary Saturday meeting was cancelled.</p>
        <p>Pressure from unbelievers in local villages is very common throughout the country. It is especially so in the rural countryside where we work so we are not surprised by this. In fact, it is an innevitable reality that we all much face as followers of Jesus. The main concern for these new believers is that they have so little knowledge and experience to draw from as they face this pressure.</p>
        <p>Please pray:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The new believers will stand fast in their young faith.</li>
          <li>God will miraculously meet them in their emotions, doubts and fears.</li>
          <li>Pastor Celebrate and James will be able to actually sit down and speak with the believers and hear their troubles, concerns and give them encouragement to continue meeting.</li>
          <li>More facts about what has happened may be collected so there is a very clear picture of what is going on. Fuzy "he said, she said" stories is an old tactic of the enemy to waste time and energy.</li>
          <li>God would draw with those who are opposing the gospel proclamation, or at least, silence this opposition.</li>

      <!--VISIT WITH DUNE MEETING WITH CELEBRATE 221113-->
      <article class="py-3 blog-post border-bottom" id="221113">
        <a href="../reports/221113.html"><h2>Visit with Dune and Meeting with Pastor Celebrate</h2></a>
        <p class="blog-post-meta mb-0"><em><a href="../2022/11.html">November</a> 13, <a href="../2022.html">2022</a> by Weston in <a href="../reports.html">Reports</a></em></p>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>Topic: <a href="../topic/dune.html">Dune</a></em></p>
        <p>Thank you all for praying for my meeting with Pastor Celebrate which took place this afternoon. We also paid a brief visit to Dune which proved encouraging.</p>
        <h5>Visit to Dune</h5>
        <p>One of the first things Celebrate said to me today was, "Dune was in very good spirits this morning when I went to pick up the kids for church. Sophia asked to go take a shower first. I almost fell over from amazement." In the past Sophia, and in fact the whole family, has rarely bathed. This was an interesting development.</p>
        <p>After church, when we took the kids home, Dune was out front sweeping the porch with a worried look on her face. "Is everything all right?" we asked.</p>
        <p>"I want to move over there and build a new house with some rooms." She pointing in the distance toward the original shack she fled to years ago where Lisa first met her. "What kind of a future will the kids have here?" she said looking around, dejectedly.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Celebrate didn't ask her where these new feelings and concerns for her children came from, which I understood to be quite remarkable. In the past she has been almost completely disinterested in what her kids are doing, likely due to her drug addiction. But where did this change come from? How long has she had these feelings? What kind of future does she envision for Film and Sophia? These are the kinds of questions we should have asked to help us understand what has changed inside Dune's own heart and mind. But, unfortunately, Celebrate spend about 20 minutes talking about land titles, deeds and how complicated it would be for her to get permission to build on someone else's land. Dune got tired of this.</p>
        <p>Thankfully at the end Celebrate told her that if it is her desire to move and build a new house for the kids to live in she should pray to God and ask for this. He is able to do anything. Her took her hand and we prayed right there for her, the kids and a new place to live. We left shortly thereafter.</p>
        <p>Upon further reflection, I think Dune's change of behavior might have more than one explanation. Firstly, it is possible that God is stirring something in her heart but unfortunately we didn't ask her any further questions so what is happening in her heart is unknown for the time being. Secondly, is also possible that what she displayed was a very normal, motherly concern for her kids and doesn't necessarily mean there is any spiritual hunger yet. But what does require some explanation and further investigation is why she appeared so normal? Is she trying to get clean from Meth? Or is it possible she had just recently taken a hit and as a result feels more normal and energetic? If that is the explanation it would be no cause to be encouraged. I know nothing about this drug. If anyone has any ideas please let us know.</p>
        <h5>Meeting with Pastor Celebrate</h5>
        <p>After leaving the house Celebrate and I drove back to the church and sat down to discuss <a href="../pray/221109.html">the questions I sent him last week</a>. I was quite disappointed in Celebrate's feedback. He had almost no ideas and nothing to say. I reframed my questions a couple times and circled back to little things he said and asked him to elaborate and slowly I understood that he really didn't have any thoughts for me.</p>
        <p> Eventually, we agreed that I would start getting involved with the family by picking up the kids and taking them to church on every other Sunday. This was clearly a felt need for Pastor Celebrate who is sixty years old and would appreciate the help shuttling the kids. I thanked him for his time and left him to rest.</p>
        <p>I drove home feeling a bit discouraged and alone. How could he really have no thoughts or ideas? How can it be that all we can do is pray and wait for a miracle? Is it not clear that something needs to insert itself into the situation to meet needs, show grace and love, and <em>teach</em> them the truth about God and themselves? But how can we do that with this specific family?</p>
        <p>Clearly, further prayer and thought is needed. In the meantime, I will see what transpires picking up the kids and taking them to church.</p>

      <!--SEARCHING FOR A MINISTRY STRATEGY WITH DUNE 221109-->
      <article class="py-3 blog-post" id="221109">
        <a href="../pray/221109.html"><h2>Searching for a Ministry Strategy with Dune</h2></a>
        <p class="blog-post-meta mb-0"><em><a href="../2022/11.html">November</a> 9, <a href="../2022.html">2022</a> by Weston in <a href="../pray.html">Pray</a></em></p>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>Topic: <a href="../topic/dune.html">Dune</a></em></p>
        <p>Please pray for me this week as I have been wrestling through how the work might progress with <a href="../topic/dune.html">Dune</a> and her children, Film and Sophia. Pastor Celebrate and everyone else, myself included, seem to be at a complete loss as to what the goals might be and how progress might be made.</p>
        <p>I have spent some time praying through these things and I have come away with these questions which I believe might be key in guiding us forward.</p>
        <h6>Questions for Pastor Celebrate</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>What are the physical needs of the family that we might be able to help meet?</li>
          <li>What are the needs of Film and Sophia, of all kinds, that we could help meet?</li>
          <li>If I went to visit the family regularly, do you see a way that I could gradually teach them more about God? How might that work? Is there an open door now? If not, how could we see that door open? I believe if they are willing to receive regular teaching this could really change everything as they are transformed by the truth.</li>
          <li>Do you think it is possible to find a regular opportunity to lay hands on and pray for Dune?</li>
          <li>If I went to visit the family by myself, do you see any dangers that I need to be aware of?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I have sent these questions to Pastor Celebrate and have arranged to meet with him in the afternoon on Sunday the 13th of November to discuss these questions and plan a strategy forward.</p>
        <p>Please pray that <em>God would bless our meeting and new clarity would emerge</em> as to how to help Dune move forward in her relationship with the Lord and recovery from drug addiction. Please pray also for her kids, Film and Sophia, that <em>the Lord would protect them and bring them into a relationship with Him also</em>.</p>
