        <h2 class="blog-post-title">2024 Ministry Update</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>October 26, 2024 by Weston in <a href="../news.html">News</a></em></p>
        <p>Hello, dear friends. We are very excited to bring you this update regarding our ministry in Thailand covering January through August 2024.</p>
        <p>But first, to quickly bring you up to speed on the big picture, Lisa and I started Home Assignment (furlough) in mid-August after a two year term on the field (Aug 2022-Aug 2024). We are currently in the Chicago area. In mid-December we will transition to Phoenix and from there we will return to Thailand at the end of February 2025. We will be sharing more about our goals and plans for Home Assignment in the next newsletter.</p>
        <p>Before we left Thailand in August, Lisa and I both felt that a "shift" had taken place in the year 2024. Typically when we pack up at the end of a term we are exhausted and can't wait to get some rest. But this time it felt strangely difficult to turn away, like we had turned a new corner or the tide had somehow changed. We saw some exciting things happen in ministry which was part of it. But also, for some unexplainable reason, ministry had started to feel lighter and more enjoyable. Even though we were actually quite tired, we felt a new, deeper kind of energy was beginning to rise for the work to which God had called us.</p>
        <p>This newsletter will be organized a little differently with less of a focus on <em>when</em> things happened and more on <em>why</em> something is significant. Let us know if you find it helpful. Everything fits into three boxes and we will conclude with prayer requests for each category. There will be plenty of pictures!</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>"Outer" Life:</strong> Our ministry of direct engagement with the lost Isaan people.</li>
          <li><strong>"Inter" Life:</strong> Our ministry focused on building up and sending out our church planting team and the national church.</li>
          <li><strong>"Inner" Life:</strong> How God is teaching, guiding, and developing us as Kingdom servants.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4 class="text-center">Outer Life: Reaching the Lost</h4>
        <h5>God's providence in our witness to government officials</h5>
        <p>The last thing</p>
        <p>Right before we left, we had two big tasks in front of us. One was to get Lisa’s work permit renewed in our own province which we have never done. Our usual process of sending it to Chiang Mai was becoming a limited option with many more hoops. Lisa also had the audacity to ask for a 2 year work permit which has not been attempted in our province but we know is an option country-wide. We also had to get our visas renewed, expecting the usual harassment and rigamarole from immigration. One thing we were not anticipating was trouble with getting the governor’s letter of recommendation which we request every year. Due to some foreign crime syndicates that have abused the foundation visa, the entire country of Thailand had a crackdown on volunteers. The governor mandated an investigation into every volunteer that was requesting a letter from him. On a day that Lisa was not scheduled to work, city hall sent a van of 10 officials to visit our foundation office and the two schools that Lisa taught at. They interviewed our office landlord as well as the village head of our foundation office. They also interviewed teachers at our school. They also requested that Lisa not be notified to come while they were investigating. The result of this investigation was that we were legitimate. Our work qualifies under the Department of Social Development and Human Security to receive a recommendation from the government. We also received a 2 year work permit renewal from the Department of Employment. With those two documents, we had no problem with getting our visas granted at immigration. </p>
        <h5>NGO Volunteer Work in Rural Villages</h5>
        <p>The experience with city hall’s investigation heightened our awareness of the importance of our foundation work. Lisa is working hard to develop a second reading curriculum, this one focusing on younger kids which may give us more access to their parents. In addition, Lisa has had a couple of opportunities to present this method of learning to two schools. It is still a work in progress. Pray that God will show the way for us to be salt and light in the community through our foundation.</p>

        <h5>Future of Evangelism Work</h5>
        <p></p>

        <h5>Prayer Requests: Outer Life</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>The new believers will stand fast in their young faith.</li>
          <li>God will doubts and fears.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="text-center">Inter Life: Equipping the Team and National Church</h4>
        <h5>Ditch County Evangelism Center</h5>
        <p><em>Sauce Village Elementary School, Ditch County</em></p>
        <p>Thank you for your prayers for the Ditch Country Evangelism Center (aka, "church") and for Pastor Victor and Pastor Happy. Over the past eight months we have seen some real growth in the quality of fellowship and regularity of attendance. A few new attendees have started to become involved regularly in serving the church and few new people have started to come more regularly.</p>
        <p>For the past year, Pastor Victor's strategy for church growth has mostly been to round up the many believers who are dispersed throughout the surrounding counties. It has been an effective strategy and an encouraging surprise to learn about believers who have lived near us for years but whom we have never had the chance to meet.</p>
          
        <h6>Gospel Training</h6>
        <p>One of the projects we have spent a great deal of time working on this year is Gospel training. The background for this project was the growing concerning over the past year that much of the preaching and teaching we have observed was lacking a Gospel focus and orientation. In addition we have observed a few attempted conversions of non-believers who came as guests to the church without actually sharing or explaining the Good News of Jesus with.</p>
        <p>This has been a concern for our team because faith in the Good News of Jesus is the only thing that is able to save us. People who have never heard the Good News cannot believe it.</p>
        <p>God had blessed and challenged Wes this past year in using his Thai language and teaching skills to conduct a gospel training for the church. Wes had a 3 week sermon focusing on what is the good news,….and so what (I forgot the middle message). Almost everybody took part including our youngest attendee, a 9-year-old.</p>

        <h6>Starting a Cell Group</h6>
        <p>We have noticed that Sundays was not a good time to get to know people intimately so we invited a family that was nearer to our town to come for food, worship and conversation. It became a regular event and the family had asked if we can just start a small group and invite others too.</p>
        <p>Over the past several months the Lord has begun putting on our hearts the idea of starting a small group at our home for some of the believers that live near. We have been testing out this idea by inviting Small and Cheeks, </p>

        <h6>Fern</h6>
        <p>One of the amazing things that happened this year was seeing God reach out to a young woman named Fern. She is seventeen years old and in her final year of high school. The day that Lisa was introduced to Fern, by another dear friend, she prayed to accept Jesus into her life. We discovered, also, that she was one of the participants of one of our first kids ministries in Bee Creek six years ago when she was only in grade school. It's amazing how quickly kids grow up.</p>
        <p>Since then we have been bringing her to church and spending time together in other ways. She has been eager to learn about the Bible and quickly began serving the other younger kids at church. It has been a real joy for us to see someone so willing and open to God and the fellowship of Christian brothers and sisters. It's so encouraging to see someone so open and willing to learn about God when usually we see so many who are closed and spiritually dead.</p>
        <p>We also had an addition to the Evangelism Center from our own town of Bee Creek. Through another Christian family, we were introduced to Fern who is in her last year of high school. She was struggling to find purpose in life and became interested in Christianity. Fern told us that she knew us from when she was in 6th grade. She joined a kid’s program that we did in her village. Fern has been going to the Evangelism Center with us regularly as well as being a part of our small group on Fridays.</p>

        <h5>Psalm 23 House Church</h5>
        <p><em>Mountain Ring County</em></p>
        <p>This is the small group led by a former student of the High School that Tim taught. Yoshua and his wife Esther along with their daughter, Dear, are standing firm in Yoshua’s hometown. They desire to be witnesses to Yoshua’s neighbors, friends, colleagues and family. It is rare to have a family in tact living in the countryside. Please pray that God will continue to supply their daily needs and bring opportunities to share the gospel in life giving ways. </p>

        <h5>Team Changes</h5>
        <p>Not a good year for this poor iguana. One of the cooks from the school accidentally hit it with her car. What do you do when you run over an iguana, you might ask? Well naturally she brought it to school and gave it to the most senior teacher as a gift.</p>
        <h6>Departure of James</h6>
        <p>In June 2024, our team experienced another sad event with James deciding to return to Australia for good. Last year he fought a battle for his visa which ended in him needing to return home unexpectedly. This visa challenges helped him understand it was no longer sustainable for him to remain on the NGO visa.</p>
        <p>It is always painful to say goodbye to teammates but James leaving has been especially hard for me. He has been a personal friend for the past almost ten years we have been on the field and he will be sorely missed. Farewell, friend!</p>

        <h6>Team Strategy Training (January 2024)</h6>
        <p>Not a good year for this poor iguana. One of the cooks from the school accidentally hit it with her car. What do you do when you run over an iguana, you might ask? Well naturally she brought it to school and gave it to the most senior teacher as a gift.</p>

        <h5>Prayer Requests: Inter Life</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>The new believers will stand fast in their young faith.</li>
          <li>God will miraculously meet them in their emotions, doubts and fears.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="text-center">Inner Life: Personal Growth</h4>
        <h5>Growing Friendships: Sunan and Nui</h5>
        <p><em>Ubon Ratchathani Province</em></p>
        <p>Sunan and Nui were our very first friends in Thailand. Sunan was the pastor of the very first church we attended when we came to Thailand ten years ago. In those initial years the word "friends" is probably too generous of our contribution because they basically took care of us like parents while we were in the intial years of language learning and culture adaptation. They served us sacrificially when we were unable to speak or understand.</p> 
        <p>But we have always had a natural friendship because Sunan and I are just one day apart in age and his wife Nui and Lisa are born the same year also. In 2017, when we transitioned from Ubon to Bee Creek (3 hrs away), they ordered the moving truck and helped us move all our stuff.</p>
        <p>Since then we've seen them rarely due to the distance and full ministry schedules but in ___ and ___ of this year we were able to visit because they started a new church plant out in the countryside of Ubon. We were able to be present for the modest but encouraging grand opening. Our time of fellowship with them this year was sweet and encouraging.</p>

        <h5>Visitors from Phoenix</h5>
        <p><em>Bee Creek</em></p>
        <p>This year we were blessed to have a number of visits from my home town of Phoenix.</p>

        <h6>Pastor Mark and Jordan</h6>
        <p>In February, Pastor Mark and Jordan from Faith Bible Church came all the way to Bee Creek to be an encouragement to us and get a sense of the work we are doing.</p>

        <h6>Conni</h6>
        <p>My sister, Conni, also came by for a few days after a set of meetings in another city in Thailand. It was so fun just hang out together in Bee Creek. It was unfortunate that it was so hot during the week she was here though. Seriously, we had a heat wave like we have never seen before in Thailand so we mostly had to hang out in the air conditioning with Conni and just chat or play games.</p>

        <h6>Dad and Mom</h6>
        <p>Finally, my parents came for a few weeks in May.</p>

        <h5>Visiting Gui and Fabi</h5>
        <p><em>North Africa</em></p>
        <p>One of the most therapeutic experiences this year has been visiting our former teammates, Gui and Fabi (from Brazil) and their daughter Nivia, whom we have not seen for over 5 years since leaving our team. As with most friendships that God so graciously allows us to experience this side of heaven, we got to pick up where we left off.</p>

        <h5>Prayer Requests: Inner Life</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>The new believers will stand fast in their young faith.</li>
          <li>God will miraculously meet them in their emotions, doubts and fears.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="text-center">Thank you!</h4>
        <h5>Thank you!</h5>
        <p>We just want to close by saying thank you to each of you who had prayed and supported us over the past year. We are so grateful for the privilege to represent our Lord Jesus in this lost place. There is SOOO much still to learn but by God's grace His Gospel will continue bearing fruit in this part of the world.</p>
