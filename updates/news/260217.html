        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>February 17, 2026 by Lisa in <a href="../news.html">News</a></em></p>
        <p>Here is our photo collage from 2025!</p>
        <hr>
        <p>We arrived on the field at the end of February 2025. We were jet lagging but just in time to help our friends who live in Chonburi, Crystal and White, “move” from one house to another.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/1.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <p>Little did we know that moving for many Thai people entails nearly taking apart their entire old house and rebuilding it at the new location. In their case though, they didn't actually have a house to move into. They had just rented a piece of land and were actively building the makeshift house while we were moving. So when someone asks for your help to move in Thailand keep in mind it’s more than just moving a few boxes!</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/2.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <p>It was a TON of work but we were very happy for our friends who moved out of Kalasin to start a life near near Bangkok. We were also able to attend their church which is very biblical and solid and they are both growing in the Word.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/3.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>In early March 2025, we arrived back in Bee Creek, Kalasin. It may sound strange but in Thailand this is the beginning of summer vacation which runs from March until early May. I needed to start a project to fulfill my Thai Foundation volunteer duties so I decided to offer a special English reading course for adult women in the community. I hired two recently graduated high school students, Fern and Mint to help me. We put up a sign and waited to see what would happen.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/4.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <p>Only one person came. She was a grandmother and she brought her grandson. We were really excited about teaching them but she seems unsure of herself. It was sad to see that even while we were teaching someone called her on the phone and made fun of her for still trying to learn English even though she was so old. Unfortunately, after that first day she did not return.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/5.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <p>With no one interested in my program I decided to focus on training Fern and Mint to work. They were sweet but it was the hardest 4 weeks of my life. They had absolutely no job skills and no work ethic or value for time management. The pressure of having to find work for the entire months of March and April contributed to our decision to come home every year during school break so we don't have to try and find work each year during summer vacation.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/6.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>At the end of April, our church had a baptism service for three people in our congregation. It was a surprise to everyone, especially to those who were going to be baptized. One lady, Myna (middle of the photo), said that she thought everyone in the church was going to get baptized. I was surprised and asked her what kind of preparation she received from the pastor and his wife. She said they didn't talk to her at all. In fact, she didn't even say that she wanted to be baptized but just heard that she was going to be baptized the week before when it was announced in church. This prompted me to start praying about discipling her.</p>

        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/8.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>This year there have been many relationship fractures in the church. It is very sad. The conflicts started while we were back in the States but by May 2025 one family in this photo stopped coming to church. Due to the conflict another family threatened to leave also.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/9.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>Also in May 2025, the Thai staff who has worked for our Foundation for the past 10 years at the head office in Chiang Mai resigned from her position. She is a dear friend so we invited her to Kalasin and we found ourselves counselling and debriefing her. She had decided to leave due to conflict with our Foundation and it was a difficult and emotional time for all of us.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/10.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>In mid May 2025, I knew that I would need to rise up to the occasion and start running a Thai Foundation for real by schmoozing with school principals, negotiating teaching methods and scheduling boundaries, thus establishing our foundation work for the coming school year.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/11.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>Teaching in public school in Thailand gives us a close look at the culture and worldivew of the Thai people. In this photo the students are paying the necessary respect to their teachers on Teacher’s Day in June.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/12.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>This year teaching has been so rewarding. It has become a passion to help others learn, whether it is learning about God or learning to read a book.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/13.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>At the end of June, our teammates the Grimaldis and their 2 year-old daughter started attending the church. This has made church much more fun and has given us more opportunities to work together as a team.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/14.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>At the beginning of July 2025, I started regularly visiting Myna (who was baptized in April). It was not an easy relationship for me. She lives in a difficult situation and at the beginning of the relationship she was constantly asking me for money and sometimes did not seem very happy that I was visiting her.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/15.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <p>But I am thankful that our relationship has really blossomed over the course of the year. I have gone from being reluctant and uncomfortable to now looking forward to our weekly bible study. We have learned to trust each other and enjoy one another's company. Praise God!</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/16.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>In July 2025 our team celebrated Wes’s 40th birthday. Our teammate's daughter, Joy, helped with baking the cake and, when the time came, helped the old man blow out his candles.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/17.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>At the end of July, Joy was admitted to the hospital. It was a scary time for all of us but she was the happiest patient in the ward. For some reason she really loves eating medicine and she knows she will get some at the hospital. During this trip she was also given a series of breathing treatments. She enjoyed it so much she is imitating putting on the breathing mask in this photo.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/18.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>Starting in August, Weston felt a burden to regularly visit Crystal's father Grandpa Eye. He has many chronic illnesses as well as dementia creeping up. Weston was able to share the Gospel but there remains a large chasm of understanding and desire for a relationship with God.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/19.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>In October 2025, We went to our organization's Regional Conference in Hua Hin. We decided to try out "slow travel" by train. We tried out all the classes (1st, 2nd, and 3rd). Third class left the biggest impression because it had no AC and because we were so close to our fellow passengers we were knocking knees. But it offered us the best views (and smells!) of Thailand. Such a beautiful country!</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/22.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/21.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/20.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <p>We really enjoyed the conference and the beautiful scenery but it took us a long time to get back to the rhythm of life when we returned to Bee Creek.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/23.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>At the end of October, the Queen Mother of Thailand passed away and the entire country went into mourning again. Typically when a member of the royal family dies the country is asked to wear black for a whole year. This year though they relaxed the rules and the government issued an official pallate of acceptable colors!</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/24.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>This year we got a surprise visit from Weston's sister Conni. It was her first time meeting our teammates the Grimaldis.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/25.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>November welcomed the second term of the school year and we were finally able to add Josh Grimaldi to the Foundation.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/26.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <hr>
        <p>As the second term of the school year started I bought a bunch of sand timers for the kids to help motivate them to focus and practice reading English faster. Suprisingly, it was a big hit!</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/27.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>

        <p>November 2025 was a month of car troubles. Our windshield cracked and we had to learn to navigate filing a claim with our insurance, which apparently is nearly impossible in any language. We also felt like it was time to replace our license plate because our plates are from Ubon, the province we lived in when we first moved to Thailand. As with everything, not changing is easier than changing.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/28.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <p>We had delayed it as long as we could until one day a cat ran into the front of our car while we were driving in front of a nearby school. We were thankful to see the cat run off unharmed but little did we know that he ran away with our license plate! (At least, the plate was gone when we stopped and looked at the car.)</p>
        <p>We went back to the school and talked to a very polite security guard who keeps an eye on the road and crosswalk. The guard let us know that he didn't find a dead cat but he would be on the lookout for our license plate. We went back a week later and he told us that he knows the cat did not die when we hit it because he has seen it running around. But he said just the day prior it was hit by another car and this time it did not survive. Still no sign of our plate.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/2026/29.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt=""></figure>
        <p>In the end, Weston had to drive out to the provincial city and get a new set of license plates. It felt like the start of a new era and we are officially, and fully Kalasin people now.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>End of November, we celebrated 14 years of marriage! God is good!!</p>
        <p>Love, Lisa and Weston</p>
