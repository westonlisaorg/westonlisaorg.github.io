        <h2 class="blog-post-title">2023 Year in Review</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>February 1, 2024 by Lisa in <a href="../news.html">News</a></em></p>
        <p>Happy belated New Year, everyone! 2024 is already flying by. We hope each of you are experiencing God's goodness and love as you start out the new year. We are missing you all.</p>
        <p>God has been so gracious to us over the past year and we want to share some of that with you in this newsletter. We have prepared a little "2023 Year in Review" with pictures. I hope you enjoy these snapshots from the past year. It is a taste of our life and ministry here: the joys and challenges, a peek into the context that we experience everyday, and a glimpse of the work that lays ahead.</p>
        
        <h4 class="text-center">January 2023</h4>
        <h5>Cultural Event</h5>
        <p><em>Sauce Village Elementary School (where Lisa volunteers M,W,F)</em></p>
        <p>Not a good year for this poor iguana. One of the cooks from the school accidentally hit it with her car. What do you do when you run over an iguana, you might ask? Well naturally she brought it to the school and gave it to the most senior teacher as a gift.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/iguana.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Everyone thinking how good that's going to taste.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>"What will you do with it?" Lisa asked the teacher.</p>
        <p>“Wrap it in foil and barbecue it," she said.</p>
        <p>Isaan people are very resourceful and have a way of turning almost anything into food.</p>
        
        <h4 class="text-center">February 2023</h4>
        <h5>Curriculum Development</h5>
        <p><em>Foundation Office, Bee Creek (our home village)</em></p>
        <p>Lisa expanded the office teaching program to include four additional kids. This office is like my private laboratory for developing curriculum that we use to help Thai students learn English which is the most immediate felt need of the community. When the curricula passes initial testing at the office it gets promoted to being used in one of our programs in the public schools and then, after further refinement, it is used in the village which is the ultimate goal.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/office.JPG" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Lisa teaching local kids at our foundation office.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>Beginning here in our office, Lisa devoted much time to developing our non-profit programs last year. As a result we saw our effectiveness in connecting with new groups of people grow exponentially throughout the year.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">March 2023</h4>
        <h5>Partnerships</h5>
        <p><em>Prosper Peak Village, Ditch County</em></p>
        <p>Pastor Victor (center) introduced us to Pastor Happy (right). We had heard tales of Pastor Happy for years and the day finally came to meet him. He is one of a very small handful of believers from the Free Mountain Tribe, a sub-group of the Isaan people. Him and his wife have been quietly following the Lord in their village for the past twenty years.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/introduction.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Pastor Happy telling us his story.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>As for Pastor Victor, he recently retired from his church in another province of Isaan and moved out to the countryside to try jumpstarting some church growth. He has patiently been working on gathering scattered believers for regular fellowship and entering new villages for evangelism.</p>
        <p>Things started out rocky with them but by God's grace our friendship and partnership with these two men and their families has steadily grown. We look forward to what future work God is preparing for us in the coming years.</p>
        
        <h5>Foreign Living</h5>
        <p><em>Department of Motor Vehicles, Swamp County</em></p>
        <p>Thailand is very different from America in almost every way. But the experience of walking in and waiting at the DMV is almost exactly the same. I'm not sure how they pulled that off.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/license.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Wes' new motorcycle license.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>Our licenses had lapsed while we were in America during the Covid season and so upon our return we had to do all the training and testing over again. We insisted on waiting in the same lines as the locals, attending the eight hour training, and finally taking the fifty question test in Thai. The scary lady at the front desk (you know the one) even pointed to us as examples to lecture the rest of the Thais in the class who weren't paying attention, “Look! Even foreigners are doing this.” But praise God we got 'em done. Legal for another five years.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">May 2023</h4>
        <h5>Curriculum Development</h5>
        <p><em>Mountain Ring Elementary Academy, Mountain Ring County</em></p>
        <p>This is me holding my first seminar for about twenty teachers at a private school to promote my phonics curriculum. The school embraced the idea of using Phonics for Thai students but in the end opted for a different curriculum that required less training for their teachers. It was a helpful experience though, enabling us to further refine the curriculum and gain valuable experience in a different setting than we are used.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/seminar.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Lisa running her first English Teaching seminar.</figcaption></figure>

        <h4 class="text-center">May 2023</h4>
        <h5>Community Programs</h5>
        <p><em>Glass Village Elementary School, Bee Creek County</em></p>
        <p>We started teaching at another village school. This one has grades from Kindergarten to 9th grade. It is called an “Expanded Opportunity School” because it includes middle school. Back in the day, schools in the village only went up to 6th grade and if they wanted to continue their education, the students would have to travel to the county school. More recently, the government decided to allow some village schools to extend their program up through 9th grade. They receive no additional funding, however, so it is a real commitment from the community.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/glassvillageelementary.JPG" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Opening of the school year year at Glass Village Elementary.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>The presence of Expanded Opportunity Schools is usually a sign that the communities are isolated and remote and the incidence of 7-12 grade youth dropout is high. If they dropout the incidence of pregnancy or drug use increases. It has become an epidemic in Thailand in recent years.</p>
        
        <h4 class="text-center">May 2023</h4>
        <h5>Team Life</h5>
        <p><em>Khon Kaen Hospital</em></p>
        <p>At the end of May, Joy Rose Grimaldi was born to our teammates, Josh and Mindy. She has quickly become the joy of our team!</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/joybirth.JPG" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">The team visiting the hospital after Joy's birth.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>This is Joy at 3 months in August.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/joy3months.JPG" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Joy at 3 months.</figcaption></figure>

        <h4 class="text-center">May-June 2023</h4>
        <h5>Church Planting</h5>
        <p><em>Ditch County Township, Ditch County</em></p>
        <p>The Ditch County Evangelism Center officially opens. It was founded by Pastor Victor and Pastor Happy and their families and we also joined making it seven adults total. It's basically a church. Not sure why they call it an evangelism center. You can read more about the opening here.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/ecenter3.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">First worship service at Ditch County Evangelism Center.</figcaption></figure>

        <h4 class="text-center">July 2023</h4>
        <h5>Foreign Living</h5>
        <p><em>Bee Creek (our home village)</em></p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/beecreekhouse.JPG" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Our housing complex in Bee Creek.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>This is our little group of Thai houses. Our landlady cut down all the trees that provided shade for our complex. They used to provide complete cover for our entire courtyard so the day they came down was very sad for us. Our landlady was fearful that the trees would blow over in a storm and crush the houses. Safety first, I guess, but it also destroyed the elegant mature trees which provided year round shade for our little tree house. An additional consequence was a subsequent termite infestation.</p>
        <p>Also, earlier in June, we experienced a tick infestation at home. We discovered thousands of nearly microscopic ticks crawling all over our bathroom. It took months to eradicate them and discover where they were coming from. In the end we pieced it together that a stray cat had managed to sneak into our house and spread pregnant ticks everywhere.</p>
        <p>As a result of all this drama we seriously started to consider moving. We stressed over this for about a month, dreading the idea of moving but feeling very unsettled where we were. We started looking for new houses. Eventually though God graciously gave us new peace that we are where he wants us and so the matter was settled. We decided to stay and learn to just deal with the termites and ticks (they are everywhere anyway).</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">July 2023</h4>
        <h5>Community Programs</h5>
        <p><em>Prosper Peak Village, Ditch County</em></p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/prosperpeakprogram.JPG" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">English teaching orientation in Prosper Peak Village.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>Pastor Victor and Pastor Happy invite our team to start an English course in Prosper Peak Village for the purpose of establishing new relationships with the village and to ultimately share Christ. We taught around sixteen kids for three and a half months. We eventually handed out certificates to four kids who had completed the curriculum in December.</p>
        
        <h4 class="text-center">August 2023</h4>
        <h5>Foreign Living</h5>
        <p><em>Foundation Office, Bee Creek (our home village)</em></p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/pifoffice.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Official photos in front of the foundation office.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>At the end of August, trouble began with visa extensions. There are many theories on why this happened but our understanding is that some criminals were using foundations for nefarious purposes. Our teammate James caught the brunt of it all and we spent about two months doing continuous visitation to immigration in order to renew his visa (left). There were a lot of new demands on our documentation and very particular wording was requested in our forms and letters.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">October 2023</h4>
        <h5>Community Programs</h5>
        <p><em>Glass Village Elementary School, Bee Creek County</em></p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/faaglasses.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Sky (14) puts on her first pair of glasses.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>In October, our foundation was able to provide glasses for Sky, a girl in 9th grade in Glass Village (pictured). Wes noticed that she was squinting a lot in class and was basically unable to see the white board at all. Fortunately, someone donated money to our foundation which provided an opportunity to take her to an eye doctor to get her eyes checked and some glasses made. It was such a small thing but when she first put them on she lit up and said, “I was blind but now I see!” We continue to pray regularly for her that God would open her spiritual eyes as well.</p>
        <p>In mid October, we had to say goodbye to our teammate, James, who tried for months to extend his visa ultimately with no success. We all just trusted and prayed that it was God’s will that he should be back in Australia with his family during this time and said a hard goodbye.</p>
        <p>But we also praise God that in the midst of that visa crisis Wes and I were able to successfully extend ours.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">November 2023</h4>
        <h5>Community Programs</h5>
        <p><em>Prosper Peak Village, Ditch County</em></p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/visitation.JPG" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Team visiting homes to complete a survey about our programming.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>We finally finished our curriculum in the village and our whole team had the privilege of visiting all the student's homes and families to collect feedback about their experience participating in our program. With the input, we will try to revamp the curriculum and learn how to better execute to program in the future. It was also good experience for our team in learning how to do home visitation together.</p>
        <p>A small treat for Lisa was that she discovered that a picture she submitted to the Moody Bible Institute calendar was selected and published. It was a photo she took while we were on vacation in Utah with her sister and brother-in-law.</p>

        <h5>Team Life</h5>
        <p>Also in November, Joy turned 6 months old.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">December 2023</h4>
        <h5>Community Programs</h5>
        <p><em>Foundation Office, Bee Creek (our home village)</em></p>
        <p>The year ended with some satisfaction. On December 17th, the church held an evangelistic Christmas event in Prosper Peak Village where we had been teaching. This was when we gave out the certificates to students who completed the curriculum.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/prosperpeakchristmas.JPG" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Handing out gifts and diplomas to those who completed our English program.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>The church had an altar call at this Christmas event but no one came forward or put up there hand. Pastor Victor later expressed privately how disappointed he was that nobody came forward. He was disappointed because he and Pastor Happy spent a lot of time in intercessory prayer over many months praying some would come to Christ at the Christmas event. They were hoping that the fruits of that time of prayer would be harvested. It was the first time that we saw how different but complementary our team's ministry methods are with theirs.</p>
        <figure class="figure"><img src="/assets/images/prosperpeakchristmas2.JPG" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Grand opening of Evangelism Center"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Christmas outreach event on Dec 10th.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>In the end, our team's assessment of this long ministry cycle in Prosper Peak Village was that our combined efforts plus the Christmas event left a positive impression on the community and gave us some new open relationships with non-believers in the community. No one has come to Christ yet but the door is open and we can build on what we have started.</p>
        <h5>Church Planting</h5>
        <p>From June to December, our little church gathering has slowly increased from 7 to 13 people (one lady holding the camera). The lady sitting down on the right is a new believer. There has also been a new family starting to come regularly as well. It's been so exciting to see us all grow in fellowship and love for God and one another. It already feels like family.</p>
