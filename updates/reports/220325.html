      <article class="py-3 blog-post">
        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Field Progress Update</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em><a href="../2022/03.html">March</a> 25, <a href="../2022.html">2022</a> by Weston in <a href="../reports.html">Reports</a></em></p>
        <p>On the 8th of March, we met with the Global Team from our sending church. This is the main accountability body to which we report. It was a very encouraging time for us as we gave them a short report regarding our last term on the field (2019-2020).</p>
        <h5>Progress:</h5>
        <h6>Village Access</h6>
        <p>We developed relationships with village leaders in three communities. This is important because our team's mission is village church planting. So, village access is everything.</p>
        <h6>Strategic Planning</h6>
        <p>Our team was able to agree on a church planting plan. We spent aproximately 6 months in 2020 hammering out our strategic plan for  how we will work toward new church plants in our target area.</p>
        <p>Our strategy is to focus on and further develop three ministries areas: (a) Evangelism leading to baptism, (b) Discipleship leading to church formation and (c) Leadership Training leading to appointment of new elders/pastors. So, preach, teach, train.</p>
        <h6>Language Checks</h6>
        <p>Lisa completed her national language checks. This enables her to move on to other projects. She is the first person on our team to complete this. (I passed my language check in Listening and Reading but I did not pass the Speaking portion.)</p>
        <h5>Problems:</h5>
        <h6>Team Challenges</h6>
        <p>Our team really struggled. We walked through exhausting, extended conflicts together. Adaptation to rural, village life in Bee Creek also hit everyone hard. In the end we lost three family units. This took a massive toll on Lisa and me.</p>
        <h6>Covid-19</h6>
        <p>It's not surprising but this created a number of challenges for our team. Safety concerns for our team members and local villagers meant much of our ministry was put on hold.</p>
        <h5>Plans for Next Term:</h5>
        <h6>Complete Language Check</h6>
        <p>This term I need to pass my national language check. This will require devoting additional time developing my speaking ability. </p>
        <h6>Team Leadership</h6>
        <p>One of the most urgent goals is to get our team functioning well. My strategy to accomplish this is to focus on the basics by communicating clearly the minimum standards for our team and supporting each member as they work to reach those standards.</p>
        <h6>Further Develop Strategic Plan</h6>
        <p>This is a tentative goal at this point but I would like to further research and develop our team's understanding of our three ministry areas (outlined above) and how they might be accomplished in our context.</p>
        <h6>Develop New Village Ministry</h6>
        <p>One major change that will take place in our new term is that Lisa will take over as the primary visa holder. This will require her to develop a new village ministry which will be the basis of our visa agreement with the government. Lisa is excited about this new venture. She desires to develop a new village ministry which will give us greater access to people's lives in rural areas.</p>
