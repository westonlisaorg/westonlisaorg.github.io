      <!--TOPIC OVERVIEW-->
        <p>Pure Glory Village is located in Plate Hills County, one of the six counties of our target area. The ministry in this village began in August 2022 with Pastor Celebrate who lived there as a child and has a close childhood friend, Ms. Small, with whom he wanted to share the gospel. Our teammate, James, reached out to Pastor Celebrate to start this new gospel initiative and they went to together to share the gospel. The result was <a href="#220924">Ms. Small and two other women professing faith</a>. Since that time James, Pastor Celebrate and other local believers have teamed up together to visit them every Saturday to teach and encourage them in their new faith.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>Topic: <a href="../topic/pure-glory-village.html">Pure Glory Village</a></em></p>
        <p>Today I spoke with Pastor Celebrate and James about the ministry in Pure Glory Village and he said that it appears that the new believers are being pressured by other unbelieving villagers to stop meeting with James, Pastor Celebrate and the others that come and assist in the teaching and worship there. Yesterday, Small, one of the new believers, declined to speak with Pastor Celebrate and the regulary Saturday meeting was cancelled.</p>
        <p>Pressure from unbelievers in local villages is very common throughout the country. It is especially so in the rural countryside where we work so we are not surprised by this. In fact, it is an innevitable reality that we all much face as followers of Jesus. The main concern for these new believers is that they have so little knowledge and experience to draw from as they face this pressure.</p>
        <p>Please pray:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The new believers will stand fast in their young faith.</li>
          <li>God will miraculously meet them in their emotions, doubts and fears.</li>
          <li>Pastor Celebrate and James will be able to actually sit down and speak with the believers and hear their troubles, concerns and give them encouragement to continue meeting.</li>
          <li>More facts about what has happened may be collected so there is a very clear picture of what is going on. Fuzy "he said, she said" stories is an old tactic of the enemy to waste time and energy.</li>
          <li>God would draw with those who are opposing the gospel proclamation, or at least, silence this opposition.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We are celebrating the first known new believers in our target area. Today, three women we reported to have confessed faith in Christ in Pure Glory Village, Plate Hills County. This has taken place as a direct result of the ministry of our teammate, James, and Pastor Celebrate, a local pastor.</p>
        <p>We covet your prayers for this new work, being led by James and Pastor Celebrate. They are scheduling regular meetings to follow up each Saturday.</p>
