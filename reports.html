      <!--ENERGY DEVELOPMENT 220401-->
      <article class="py-3 blog-post border-bottom" id="220401">
        <a href="https://westonlisa.org/reports/220401-energy-development"><h2>Energy Development</h2></a> 
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>April 1, 2022 by Weston in Life</em></p>
        <p>One of the personal challenges I face is having low-energy.</p>
        <p>Last year I took a test as part of a leadership training course through our organization. One of the dimensions they tested me on was my level of "physical energy." This measured how much physical activity I am wired with. Some people are the go, go, go type. As you know, this is NOT me. So, I was not surprised to discover my number was low. But I had no idea how low it was.</p>
        <p>On a scale of 1-99, my score was 2.</p>
        <p>This is a particular challenge for me because there is almost no aspect of my job on the field that is not energy intensive. Sometimes I wish I could show up to work and someone would say, "We just need you to move the data from these columns over here." Or, "Stuff these envelopes but take your time. It's not urgent." That would be awesome. (I'm sure no one actually has a job like this.)</p>
        <p>Instead, my job is more like: "Listen to these people very carefully for the next several hours." And, "Put a tie on, stand in the heat for 3 hours and teach these sleeping kids some English." Or, "Read all these books and design a new evangelism strategy. Keep in mind, evangelism has never worked here before."</p>
        <p>(Sigh)</p>
        <p>Well, there's nothing I can do about the nature of my job. But this year I have been trying to develop some new strategies to help me cope with my physical energy limitations. I have thought of two things so far. (Let me know if you have any other ideas I can try.)</p>
        <p>The first is to exercise regularly. I believe this may help increase the energy capacity of my system. This was actually already a steady habit for me on the field. I didn't do it for this reason but it really helped me. It helped me process things and I felt so energized afterward. This year I developed a new training plan to gradually expand my body's energy system even further. I am very hopeful about this.</p>
        <p>The second is to keep a very tight leash on my To Do List. Because I am often feeling tired I have a tendency to put things off. This in turn creates a pile of work that is waiting for me when I return. Finally, deadlines become urgent and I have to conjure up enough energy to clear my to do list. But, due to the adrenaline and the long hours spent catching up, I end up more tired in the end than I was at the beginning of the cycle. A recovery period is required during which time new things start to pile up. Some seasons follow this pattern more than others but this is generally how I have lived most of my life.</p>
        <p>So, I've decided to make a change this year: to tenaciously get things done as soon as they appear, whether they are urgent or not. "Just get it done, now." I know this is not a new idea but I've come to realize how potentially valuable this system could be for me. I believe this will have the effect of keeping more energy in my system by preventing "the crash." This energy reserve can then be invested into "less urgent, more profitable" projects instead of saving it to catch up.</p>
        <p>I pray focusing on these two areas will help me become more energized and be more productive.</p>

      <!--FIELD PROGRESS UPDATE 220325-->
      <article class="py-3 blog-post border-bottom" id="220325">
        <a href="https://westonlisa.org/reports/220325-field-progress-update"><h2>Field Progress Update</h2></a> 
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>March 25, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
        <p>On the 8th of March, we met with the Global Team from our sending church. This is the main accountability body to which we report. It was a very encouraging time for us as we gave them a short report regarding our last term on the field (2019-2020).</p>
        <h5>Progress:</h5>
        <h6>Village Access</h6>
        <p>We developed relationships with village leaders in three communities. This is important because our team's mission is village church planting. So, village access is everything.</p>
        <h6>Strategic Planning</h6>
        <p>Our team was able to agree on a church planting plan. We spent aproximately 6 months in 2020 hammering out our strategic plan for  how we will work toward new church plants in our target area.</p>
        <p>Our strategy is to focus on and further develop three ministries areas: (a) Evangelism leading to baptism, (b) Discipleship leading to church formation and (c) Leadership Training leading to appointment of new elders/pastors. So, preach, teach, train.</p>
        <h6>Language Checks</h6>
        <p>Lisa completed her national language checks. This enables her to move on to other projects. She is the first person on our team to complete this. (I passed my language check in Listening and Reading but I did not pass the Speaking portion.)</p>
        <h5>Problems:</h5>
        <h6>Team Challenges</h6>
        <p>Our team really struggled. We walked through exhausting, extended conflicts together. Adaptation to rural, village life in Bee Creek also hit everyone hard. In the end we lost three family units. This took a massive toll on Lisa and me.</p>
        <h6>Covid-19</h6>
        <p>It's not surprising but this created a number of challenges for our team. Safety concerns for our team members and local villagers meant much of our ministry was put on hold.</p>
        <h5>Plans for Next Term:</h5>
        <h6>Complete Language Check</h6>
        <p>This term I need to pass my national language check. This will require devoting additional time developing my speaking ability. </p>
        <h6>Team Leadership</h6>
        <p>One of the most urgent goals is to get our team functioning well. My strategy to accomplish this is to focus on the basics by communicating clearly the minimum standards for our team and supporting each member as they work to reach those standards.</p>
        <h6>Further Develop Strategic Plan</h6>
        <p>This is a tentative goal at this point but I would like to further research and develop our team's understanding of our three ministry areas (outlined above) and how they might be accomplished in our context.</p>
        <h6>Develop New Village Ministry</h6>
        <p>One major change that will take place in our new term is that Lisa will take over as the primary visa holder. This will require her to develop a new village ministry which will be the basis of our visa agreement with the government. Lisa is excited about this new venture. She desires to develop a new village ministry which will give us greater access to people's lives in rural areas.</p>

      <!--PHOENIX TIME EXTENDED 220318-->

        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>March 18, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
        <p>Lisa and I have decided to extend out time in Phoenix through May.</p>
        <p>Originally we planned to spend the month of May in Chicago doing a special time of prayer, planning and field preparation. But because we have been able to rest so well here in Phoenix we decided to do our pre-field preparation here instead of in Chicago.</p>
        <p><a href="https://westonlisa.org/pray/220228-rest-needed">This is a big answer to prayer.</a> Thank you for praying for rest! I daresay that this is almost the first time that Lisa and I have felt truly refreshed since we left for the field in 2014.</p>

      <!--WESTONLISA.ORG SEES NEW LIFE 220304-->
      <article class="py-3 blog-post border-bottom" id="220304">
        <a href="https://westonlisa.org/reports/220304-westonlisa-org-sees-new-life"><h2>WestonLisa.org Sees New Life</h2></a>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>March 4, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
        <p>When we left for the field in 2014 we had our website based on Wordpress. It was a great way of keeping people in touch with what we were doing.</p>
        <p>Over the years though, the demands of keeping up the platform became too much. Wordpress has a number of vulnerabilities that I needed to keep an eye on. The expense of using shared hosting and SSL certificates continued to increase as the years went by. In the end we were spending a couple hundred dollars per year on the site. So finally, reluctantly, we decided to close down the old WestonLisa.Org blog. I was grieved, but we had no choice. Things were just not working.</p>
        <p>Since we have been back in the US my desire has grown to relaunch. A website is unparalleled when it comes to keeping people informed. Newsletters alone are just not enough to keep everyone informed. </p>
        <p>But what platform could we use? Could we avoid the expense of web hosting and SSL certificates? Was it possible to have a truly free website?? These conditions seemed impossible to meet.</p>
        <p>I believe God led me to discovering Bootstrap and Github Pages.</p>

        <p>It is so amazing to finally be back in Phoenix. I always forget what a paradise this place is during the winter. Our last day in Chicago was 40 degrees and raining with ice on the ground. Such a difference!</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>February 11, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
        <p>This week we have been packing up our house in Chicago and today we are saying goodbye. </p>
        <p>This is one of the hardest parts of the missionary life for me. I should have seen this coming but I am not ready to say goodbye. I was not able to prepare myself emotionally for this. But, ready or not, today is the last day.</p>
        <p>I will always remember this house fondly. It was only temporary and we have only lived here for one year but I will never forget it. God came and met with us here in this place. Wherever we are God's tabernacling presence follows us. It was especially so in this house. He provided all of our needs and more. He taught us so many hard but beautiful lessons. We spent sweet quality time with Lisa's Dad here. For him this was a house of healing.</p>
