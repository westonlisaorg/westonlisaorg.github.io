        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>April 4, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
        <p>This week my heart has been particularly pressed to pray and seek after God's will in the coming term on the field. It is so easy to make assumptions that we know God's mind.</p>
        <p>Please pray:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>God would increase our desire to see his will done alone.</li>
          <li>God would change our hearts so that we increasingly desire his glory to be made known.</li>
          <li>God would reveal his will to us as we return to the field.</li>

        <p><a href="https://westonlisa.org/pray/220322-james-ministry-vision-and-equipping-plan">In our last prayer update</a> I wrote about James' ministry plan and my meeting with Dennis. This meeting went very well and he helped me think things through. Thank you for praying.</p>
        <p>This week please pray as I prepare for meetings with with James' sending church pastor, David (March 29). This will be my first time meeting with him. I will also be giving James feedback regarding his ministry plan on March 30th.</p>
        <p>Just to be clear: there is nothing negative under review in these meetings. All of these meetings are routine. I am requesting prayer because it is meetings like these that really stretch me as a leader and require me to pray a lot and seek the Lord's wisdom when I am giving members input.</p>
        <p>Please pray:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>God would give me wisdom this week as I prepare for meetings on the 29th and 30th.</li>
          <li>God would give me sensitivity and understanding as I ask questions, listen and discuss the ministry plan with David and James.</li>
          <li>God would give me discernment and insight as I compile my final ministry plan input for James.</li>
          <li>Pray for James as he receives this input and continues seeking the Lord's will in his next term on the field (starting April 30th).</li>

        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>March 22, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
        <p>James is one of our teammates. He is currently in Australia on Home Assignment. Since December he and I have been working on his Ministry Vision and Equipping Plan for his next term on the field which starts on May 1st. Last week James submitted his final draft to me for my approval.</p>
        <p>This week I will be praying through the document and will be discussing it with Dennis, our field leader. Our goal is to provide helpful feedback for James to consider, making his plan more clear, measurable and effective. </p>
        <p>My desire is to be able to approve this plan next week.</p>
        <p>As Dennis and I meet on Thursday, the 24th, please pray:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We will find helpful feedback for James.</li>
          <li>I would see clearly the kind of support from me James needs to be effective.</li>
          <li>God would be glorfied through this plan and the work he is preparing for James in the coming term.</li>

        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>March 14, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
        <p>Next week, on the 20th and 22nd, I will be doing a debrief time with Josh and Mindy, our teammates who are currently on the field. They haved completed their first year in Blackriver province. This is my first time doing a debrief during a term but I thought it would be good to debrief together since the first year is such a crucial period. (Usually debriefs are conducted at the conclusion of a term of service.)</p>
        <p>Debrief sessions are very special to me as a team leader. They are opportunities to listen, pray and encourage. I always see God speak to members as they seek him and celebrate him faithfulness.</p>
        <p>Please pray:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>God would lead me as I prepare the activities, materials and schedule.</li>
          <li>God would speak to Josh and Mindy as they reflect and seek him.</li>
          <li>Josh and Mindy would be refreshed and encouraged during the debrief on March 20, 22.</li>

        <p>I will be spending a lot of time over the next month preparing for this time and writing out what we believe the Lord wants us to share.</p>

        <p>This week we are connecting with supporters in Phoenix and preparing a few other presentations for the coming weeks. The missions conference was incredibly inspiring and encouraging but we are pretty tired.</p>
        <p>Please pray:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>That we would be able to rest and recover from the mission conference and the two presentations we gave last week. We are tired.</li>

        <p>This week we are packing up our house in Chicago. We have lived here for exactly one year. What a refuge and a blessing this house has been. It has been a house of healing for Lisa's Dad. It has been a refuge for us. God has met us and taught us many things in these walls. He has supplied all of our needs. We praise the Lord for this place.</p>
        <p>It will be emotional packing up and saying goodbye. This is one of the hard things about this kind of work: we have no permanent place to live.</p>
        <p>Please pray that we would feel these transitions deeply.</p>
