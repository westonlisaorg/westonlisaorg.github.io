        <p>This week we are connecting with supporters in Phoenix and preparing a few other presentations for the coming weeks. The missions conference was incredibly inspiring and encouraging but we are pretty tired.</p>
        <p>Please pray:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>That we would be able to rest and recover from the mission conference and the two presentations we gave last week. We are tired.</li>
          <li>That God would continue to show us how to prepare upcoming presentations and adapt our material to be inspiring to the various audiences we have been invited to speak with.</li>

        <p>This week we are participating in a missions conference at one of our supporting churches in the Phoenix area. We will be presenting on Tuesday, the 22nd.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>God would give us passion and clarity as we share with many new people about our mission work.</li>
          <li>That many would be inspired to partner through prayer.</li>
          <li>That Jesus would be glorified and exalted as we share and meet with many.</li>
          <li>Our presentation on the 22nd would be smooth and clear.</li>

        <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>February 7, 2022 by Weston</em></p>
        <p>This week we are packing up our house in Chicago. We have lived here for exactly one year. What a refuge and a blessing this house has been. It has been a house of healing for Lisa's Dad. It has been a refuge for us. God has met us and taught us many things in these walls. He has supplied all of our needs. We praise the Lord for this place.</p>
        <p>It will be emotional packing up and saying goodbye. This is one of the hard things about this kind of work: we have no permanent place to live.</p>
        <p>Please pray that we would feel these transitions deeply.</p>
